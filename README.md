## Notice

I just wrote this, don't analyze it as it's very nasty.  
For now I've kind of setup a decent folder structure,  
but will probably change soon, not that it matters, right? As long as it twerks!  
There are plenty of works left,  
and you can see the backlog right over there => https://github.com/dugzino/sale-availability-check/projects
