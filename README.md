## Notice
I just wrote this, don't analyze it as it's very nasty.  
For now I've kind of setup a decent folder structure, but will probably change soon, not that it matters, right? As long as it twerks!

## Getting Started
1. This script requires nodeJS.  
So visit: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. `git clone` this repo wherever you want.
3. Open a terminal inside the repo folder _(where you just cloned)_.
4. Run `npm i`
5. Run `npm run add-service`.  
Remember it's only for RDC for now. sorry '-_-
6. Run `npm run search`

## Additional info
To terminate job `CTRL+C` for Linux, Windows, and it should probably work the same way for MacOS _(hopefully)_.
