## Notice

I just wrote this, don't analyze it as it's very nasty.  
For now I've kind of setup a decent folder structure,  
but will probably change soon, not that it matters, right? As long as it twerks!  
There are plenty of works left,  
and you can see the backlog right over there => https://github.com/dugzino/sale-availability-check/projects

## Getting Started

1. This script requires nodeJS. So visit: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Open a terminal inside the repo folder _(where you just cloned)_.

5. Run `npm run add-service`.  
**Remember it's only for RDC for now. sorry** '-_-

## Additional info

To terminate job `CTRL+C` for Linux, Windows, and it should probably work the same way for MacOS _(hopefully)_.
